## About


Hi, I'm Tiffany! I have data science degree with concentration in business analytics from UC Berkeley. Throughout my college time, I have developed a strong foundation in handling large datasets and turning data into valuable insights. I am excited to bring my analytical skills to the field of data science as an entry-level data analyst.

I particularly specialized in cleaning data, building automatic dashboard, and helping company on making data-driven business decision. I am an expert on SQL, Python, and Mixpanel for data analysis and data visualization. I also gained experience in machine learning, data management, and statistical analysis, which I believe will be valuable assets in data analyst role.

This is a repository that I have created to showcase skills, share projects and track my progress in Data Analytics / Data Science related topics.

### Analyzing BellaBeat's Data to Gain Insight into How Consumers are Using Their Smart Devices.
**Code:** [Analysis Code.ipynb](https://github.com/tiffanynatasha/Bellabeat-Case-Study/blob/main/Code.ipynb)
**Presentation:** [Bellabeat Powerpoint](https://github.com/tiffanynatasha/Bellabeat-Case-Study/blob/main/%20Bellabeat%20Case%20Study%20Slide%20Presentation.pdf)

**Goal:** To analyze customers' behavior on Bellabeat's smart device.

**Description:** The project focused on analyzing a dataset of user's behavior data related to their activity, sleep, and stress habits. The project involved loading the data, cleaning and preprocessing it, performing exploratory data analysis (EDA), creating data visualization, and analyzing the correlation between activity and sleep. 

**Skills:** Data cleaning, data analysis, and data visualization.

**Technology:** Python, Pandas, Numpy, Seaborn, Matplotlib, SciPy.

**Results:** Based on our analysis, most users did not meet CDC guideline in terms of number of steps and hours of sleeps. Thus, Bellabeat should work on sleep improvement feature and push notifications to increase engagement on activity.
