# Data Analytics Portfolio-

## About


Hi, I'm Tiffany! I have a data science degree with concentration in business analytics from UC Berkeley. Throughout my studies, I have developed a strong foundation in handling large datasets and turning data into valuable insights. I am excited to bring my analytical skills to the field of data science as an entry-level data analyst.

I particularly specialized in cleaning data, building automatic dashboard, and helping company on making data-driven business decisions. I am an expert in SQL, Python, and Mixpanel for data analysis and data visualization. I also gained experience in machine learning, data management, and statistical analysis, which I believe will be valuable assets in data analyst role.

This is a repository that I have created to showcase skills, share projects and track my progress in Data Analytics / Data Science related topics.

## Projects
### Analyzing BellaBeat's Data to Gain Insight into How Consumers are Using Their Smart Devices
**Code:** [Analysis Code.ipynb](https://github.com/tiffanynatasha/Bellabeat-Case-Study/blob/main/Code.ipynb)

**Presentation:** [Bellabeat Powerpoint](https://github.com/tiffanynatasha/Bellabeat-Case-Study/blob/main/%20Bellabeat%20Case%20Study%20Slide%20Presentation.pdf)

**Goal:** To analyze customers' behavior on Bellabeat's smart device.

**Description:** The project focused on analyzing a dataset of user's behavior data related to their activity, sleep, and stress habits. The project involved loading the data, cleaning and preprocessing it, performing exploratory data analysis (EDA), creating data visualization, and analyzing the correlation between activity and sleep. 

**Skills:** Data cleaning, data analysis, and data visualization.

**Technology:** Python, Pandas, Numpy, Seaborn, Matplotlib, SciPy.

**Results:** Based on our analysis, most users did not meet CDC guideline in terms of number of steps and hours of sleeps. Thus, Bellabeat should work on sleep improvement feature and notification push to increase engagement on activity. 


### Analyzing Research Program Diversity and Post-Graduation Employment
**Code:** [Analysis Code.ipynb](https://github.com/tiffanynatasha/URAP-/blob/main/Analysis.ipynb)

**Goal:** To analyze the researh program's diversity and evaluate the program’s effectiveness by identifying the correlation between the program’s participation and post-graduation employment likelihood.

**Description:** The project focused on analyzing a dataset of students' demographic data such as race, gender, major and their post-graduation employment. The project involved loading the data, cleaning and preprocessing it, performing exploratory data analysis (EDA), creating data visualization, and analyzing the correlation between student's participation on research program and post-graduation employment. 

**Skills:** Data cleaning, data analysis, and data visualization.

**Technology:** Python, Pandas, Numpy, Seaborn, Matplotlib, SciPy.

**Results:** Based on our analysis, a certain race is very dominant on research program participation, so the board members should make the program more diverse. 


### COVID-19 Death Prediction
**Code:** [Machine Learning Code.ipynb](https://github.com/tiffanynatasha/COVID-19-analysis/blob/main/predict_death_covid_cases.ipynb)

**Presentation:**[COVID-19 Powerpoint](https://github.com/tiffanynatasha/COVID-19-analysis/blob/main/Final%20Presentation%20IND%20ENG%20142.pdf)

**Goal:** To predict COVID-19 patient's death based on patient's data.

**Description:** The project focused on applying machine learning techniques on patient's data. The data includes race, gender, age, hospitalization status, and vaccination status. The project involved loading the data, cleaning and preprocessing it, performing exploratory data analysis (EDA), creating data visualization, and applying machine learning models to data. 

**Skills:** Data cleaning, data analysis, data visualization, and machine learning.

**Technology:** Python, Pandas, Numpy, Seaborn, Matplotlib, SciPy, Sklearn.

**Results:** Vaccination helps decrease the number of COVID-19 cases, and thus an action to raise awareness of COVID-19 vaccination is needed. 


### COVID-19 Crypto Analysis 
**Code:** [Crypto Analysis Code.ipynb](https://github.com/tiffanynatasha/Crypto-Analysis/blob/main/Crypto_API_final.ipynb)

**Presentation:**[Crypto Analysis Powerpoint](https://github.com/tiffanynatasha/Crypto-Analysis/blob/main/Crypto%20For%20Dummies.pptx)

**Goal:** To predict each crypto coin's rating and transfer it to a leaderboard. 

**Description:** The project started with web scraping crypto website to gather data. The data includes each crypto coin market capacity, price, and change percentage. The project involved loading the data, cleaning and preprocessing it,  applying machine learning models to produce the coin's rating, and then present it into a leaderboard website. 

**Skills:** Web scraping, Data cleaning, and machine learning.

**Technology:** Python, Pandas, Numpy, SciPy, Sklearn, Anvil.

**Results:** A leaderboard of crypto coin based on our predicted ratings.
