# Data-Analytics-
This is a repository that I have created to showcase skills, share projects and track my progress in Data Analytics / Data Science related topics.

Hi, I'm Tiffany! I have data science degree with concentration in business analytics from UC Berkeley. Throughout my college time, I have developed a strong foundation in handling large datasets and turning data into valuable insights. I am excited to bring my analytical skills to the field of data science as an entry-level data analyst.

I particularly specialized in cleaning data, building automatic dashboard, and helping company on making data-driven business decision. I am an expert on SQL, Python, and Mixpanel for data analysis and data visualization. I also gained experience in machine learning, data management, and statistical analysis, which I believe will be valuable assets in data analyst role.
